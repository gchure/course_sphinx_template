About
=====

Welcome! This website corresponds to a template for building academic course 
websites using `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_, a documentation 
generator using Python. Many of our course materials are developed using Jupyter 
notebooks, making documentation generation a great way to make them searchable without 
worrying about configuring HTML output and integration with other hosting solutions

Deployment
----------
This website is built from the `parent GitHub repository <https://github.com/gchure/course_sphinx_template>`_
using a GitHub action. In short, every time you tag a release on the parent repository, the website is 
automatically compiled and rehosted. This allows you to develop and commit changes 
to the website, without constantly recompiling. 

Usage
-----
To use this website, navigate to the `parent repository <https://github.com/gchure/course_sphinx_template>`_
and click the "Use This Template" button. Enter the desired name of your course
